     * that can be used as a place holder for the real attribute use
     * object it is referring to.
     * So whenever the parser detects an attribute reference, it creates
     * a XsdAttributeReference and returns it instead of the XsdAttributeUse.
     * During a later phase, the resolver will look for all XsdAttributeReferences
     * in the schema and will replace them with their referring XsdAttributeUse
     * objects.
