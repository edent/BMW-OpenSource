<a name="getting-started"></a>
<h3>Getting Started</h3>
<p>We assume that you already know C++ and will be using it for Qt development. See the <a href="http://qt.nokia.com/">Qt website</a> for more information about using other programming languages with Qt.</p>
<p>If you want to program purely in C++, designing your interfaces in code without the aid of any design tools, take a look at the <a href="tutorials.html">Tutorials</a>. These are designed to get you into Qt programming, with an emphasis on working code rather than being a tour of features.</p>
<p>If you want to design your user interfaces using a design tool, then read at least the first few chapters of the <a href="designer-manual.html">Qt Designer manual</a>.</p>
<p>By now you'll have produced some small working applications and have a broad feel for Qt programming. You could start work on your own projects straight away, but we recommend reading a couple of key overviews to deepen your understanding of Qt: <a href="object.html">Qt Object Model</a> and <a href="signalsandslots.html">Signals and Slots</a>.</p>

<a name="getting-an-overview"></a>
<h3>Getting an Overview</h3>
<p>At this point, we recommend looking at the <a href="overviews.html">overviews</a> and reading those that are relevant to your projects. You may also find it useful to browse the source code of the <a href="examples.html">examples</a> that have things in common with your projects. You can also read Qt's source code since this is supplied.</p>
<p>If you run the <a href="qtdemo.html">Examples and Demos Launcher</a>, you'll see many of Qt's widgets in action.</p>
<p>The <a href="gallery.html">Qt Widget Gallery</a> also provides overviews of selected Qt widgets in each of the styles used on various supported platforms. <div style="clear: both"></p>
<a name="books-and-learning-materials"></a>
<h3>Books and Learning Materials</h3>
<p>Qt comes with extensive documentation, with hypertext cross-references throughout, so you can easily click your way to whatever interests you. The part of the documentation that you'll probably use the most is the <a href="index.html">API Reference</a>. Each link provides a different way of navigating the API Reference; try them all to see which work best for you. You might also like to try <a href="assistant-manual.html#qt-assistant">Qt Assistant</a>: this tool is supplied with Qt and provides access to the entire Qt API, and it provides a full text search facility.</p>
<p>There are also a growing number of books about Qt programming. We recommend the official Qt book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0132354160/ref=ase_trolltech/">C++ GUI Programming with Qt 4, Second Edition</a> (ISBN 0-13-235416-0). This book provides comprehensive coverage of Qt programming all the way from &quot;Hello Qt&quot; to advanced features such as multithreading, 2D and 3D graphics, networking, item view classes, and XML. (The first edition, which is based on Qt 4.1, is available <a href="http://www.qtrac.eu/C++-GUI-Programming-with-Qt-4-1st-ed.zip">online</a>.)</p>
<p>See <a href="http://qt.nokia.com/developer/books">Books about Qt Programming</a> for a complete list of Qt books, including translations to various languages.</p>
<p>Another valuable source of example code and explanations of Qt features is the archive of articles from <a href="http://qt.nokia.com/doc/qq/">Qt Quarterly</a>, a quarterly newsletter for users of Qt.</p>
<p>For documentation on specific Qt modules and other guides, refer to <a href="overviews.html">All Overviews and HOWTOs</a>.</p>

<h3>Further Reading</h3>
<p>Qt has an active and helpful user community who communicate using the <a href="http://lists.trolltech.com">qt-interest</a> mailing list, the <a href="http://www.qtcentre.org">Qt Centre</a> Web site, and a number of other community Web sites and Weblogs. In addition, many Qt developers are active members of the <a href="http://www.kde.org">KDE community</a>.</p>
<p>Good luck, and have fun!</p>
