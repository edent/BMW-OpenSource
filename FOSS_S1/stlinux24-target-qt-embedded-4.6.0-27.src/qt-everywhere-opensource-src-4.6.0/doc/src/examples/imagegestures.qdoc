    \title Image Gestures Example

    This example shows how to enable gestures for a widget and use gesture input
    to perform actions.

    \image imagegestures-example.png Screenshot of the Image Gestures example.

    We use two classes to create the user interface for the application: \c MainWidget
    and \c ImageWidget. The \c MainWidget class is simply used as a container for the
    \c ImageWidget class, which we will configure to accept gesture input. Since we
    are interested in the way gestures are used, we will concentrate on the
    implementation of the \c ImageWidget class.

    \section1 ImageWidget Class Definition

    The \c ImageWidget class is a simple QWidget subclass that reimplements the general
    QWidget::event() handler function in addition to several more specific event handlers:

    \snippet examples/gestures/imagegestures/imagewidget.h class definition begin
    \dots
    \snippet examples/gestures/imagegestures/imagewidget.h class definition end

    We also implement a private helper function, \c gestureEvent(), to help manage
    gesture events delivered to the widget, and three functions to perform actions
    based on gestures: \c panTriggered(), \c pinchTriggered() and \c swipeTriggered().

    \section1 ImageWidget Class Implementation

    In the widget's constructor, we begin by setting up various parameters that will
    be used to control the way images are displayed.

    \snippet examples/gestures/imagegestures/imagewidget.cpp constructor

    We enable three of the standard gestures for the widget by calling QWidget::grabGesture()
    with the types of gesture we need. These will be recognized by the application's
    default gesture recognizer, and events will be delivered to our widget.

    Since QWidget does not define a specific event handler for gestures, the widget
    needs to reimplement the general QWidget::event() to receive gesture events.

    \snippet examples/gestures/imagegestures/imagewidget.cpp event handler

    We implement the event handler to delegate gesture events to a private function
    specifically written for the task, and pass all other events to QWidget's
    implementation.

    The \c gestureHandler() function examines the gestures supplied by the
    newly-delivered QGestureEvent. Since only one gesture of a given type can be
    used on a widget at any particular time, we can check for each gesture type
    using the QGestureEvent::gesture() function:

    \snippet examples/gestures/imagegestures/imagewidget.cpp gesture event handler

    If a QGesture object is supplied for a certain type of gesture, we call a special
    purpose function to deal with it, casting the gesture object to the appropriate
    QGesture subclass.

    To illustrate how a standard gesture can be interpreted by an application, we
    show the implementation of the \c swipeTriggered() function, which handles the
    gesture associated with a brushing or swiping motion on the user's display or
    input device:

    \snippet examples/gestures/imagegestures/imagewidget.cpp swipe function

    The QSwipeGesture class provides specialized functions and defines a enum
    to make it more convenient for developers to discover which direction, if
    any, the user swiped the display. Here, we simply navigate to the previous
    image in the collection if the user swiped upwards or to the left; otherwise
    we navigate to the next image in the collection.

    The other gestures are also handled by special purpose functions, but use
    the values of properties held by the QGesture object passed to them.
